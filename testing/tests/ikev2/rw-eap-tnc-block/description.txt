The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>
using EAP-TTLS authentication only with the gateway presenting a server certificate and
the clients doing EAP-MD5 password-based authentication.
In a next step the EAP-TNC protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS tunnel to determine the
health of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> via the <b>IF-TNCCS 1.1</b> client-server interface.
<b>carol</b> passes the health test and <b>dave</b> fails. Based on these measurements
<b>carol</b> is authenticated successfully and is granted access to the subnet behind
<b>moon</b> whereas <b>dave</b> fails the layered EAP authentication and is rejected.
