  * Fix DoS issue via malicious Dead Peer Detection packet. Thanks to the 
    security team for providing the patch.
    Closes: #521950: CVE-2009-0790: DoS

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Tue, 31 Mar 2009 12:00:51 +0200

strongswan (4.2.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This is now compatible with network-manager 0.7
    in Debian, so start building the strongswan-side support. The actual
    plugin will need to be another source package.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Mar 2009 10:59:31 +0100

strongswan (4.2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Starting with this version, the strongswan
    packages is modularized and includes support for plugins like the 
    NetworkManager plugin. Many details were adopted from Martin Willi's
    packages.
  * Dropping support for raw RSA public/private keypairs, as charon does
    not support it.
  * Explicitly remove directories /etc/ipsec.d and /var/run/pluto on purge.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Sun, 01 Mar 2009 10:46:08 +0000

                     fetching not available
  * Enable compilation with SSH agent support.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Fri, 05 Dec 2008 17:21:42 +0100

strongswan (4.2.4-5) unstable; urgency=high

  Reason for urgency high: this is potentially security relevant.
  * Patch backported from 4.2.7 to fix a potential DoS issue.
    Thanks to Thomas Kallenberg for the patch.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Sep 2008 10:35:30 +0200

strongswan (4.2.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tweaked configure options for lenny to remove somewhat experimental,
    incomplete, or unnecessary features. Removed --enable-xml,
    --enable-padlock, and --enable-manager and added --disable-aes,
    --disable-des, --disable-fips-prf, --disable-gmp, --disable-md5,
    --disable-sha1, and --disable-sha2 because openssl already
    contains this code, we depend on it and thus don't need it twice.
    Padlock support does not do much, because the bulk encryption uses
    it anyway (being done internally in the kernel) and using padlock
    for IKEv2 key agreement adds complexity for little gain.
    Thanks to Thomas Kallenberg of strongswan upstream team for 
    suggesting these changes. The package is now noticable smaller.
  * Also remove dbus dependency, which is no longer necessary.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Sep 2008 08:59:10 +0200

strongswan (4.2.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed configure option to build peer-to-peer service again.
    Closes: #494678: strongswan: configure option --enable-p2p changed to 
                     --enable-mediation

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Aug 2008 20:08:26 +0200

strongswan (4.2.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Urgency medium because this fixes an FTFBS bug on non-i386.
  * Only compile padlock crypto acceleration support for i386. Thanks for
    the patch!
    Closes: #492455: strongswan: FTBFS: Uses i386 assembler on non-i386 
                     arches. 
  * Updated Swedish debconf translation.
    Closes: #492902: [INTL:sv] po-debconf file for strongswan

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Aug 2008 13:02:54 +0200

strongswan (4.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Urgency medium because this new upstream versions no longer uses
  dbus and thus fixed the grave bug from the last Debian package. This
  version should transit to testing.
  * New upstream release. Starting with version 4.2.0, crypto algorithms have
    beeen modularized with existing code ported over. Among other improvments, 
    this version now supports AES-CCM (e.g. with esp=aes128ccm12) and AES-GCM
    (e.g. with esp=aes256gcm16) starting with kernel 2.6.25 and enables dead
    peer detection by default.
    Note that charon (IKEv2) now uses the new /etc/strongswan.conf.
  * Enabled building of VIA Padlock and openssl crypto plugins.
  * Drop patch to rename AES_cbc_encrypt so as not to conflict with an
    openssl method of the same name. This has been applied upstream.
  * This new upstream version no longer uses dbus.
    Closes: #475098: charon needs dbus but strongswan does not depend on dbus
    Closes: #475099: charon does not work any more
  * This new upstream version no longer prints error messages in its
    init script.
    Closes: #465718: strongswan: startup on booting returns error messages 
  * Apply patch to ipsec init script to fix bashism.
    Closes: #473703: strongswan: bashism in /bin/sh script 
  * Updated Czech debconf translation.
    Closes: #480928: [l10n] Updated Czech translation of strongswan debconf

strongswan (4.1.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * DBUS support now interacts with network-manager, so need to build-depend
    on network-manager-dev.
  * The web interface has been improved and now requires libfcgi-dev and
    clearsilver-dev to compile, so build-depend on them. Also build-depend
    on libxml2-dev, libdbus-1-dev, libtool, and libsqlite3-dev (which were 
    all build-deps before but were not listed explicitly so far - fix that).
  * Add patch to rename internal AES_cbc_encrypt function and thus avoid
    conflict with the openssl function.
    Closes: #470721: pluto segfaults when using pkcs11 library linked with 
                     OpenSSL

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Mar 2008 10:35:16 +0200

strongswan (4.1.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable new configure options: dbus, xml, nonblocking, thread, peer-
    to-peer NAT-traversal and the manager interface support.
  * Also set the default path to the opensc-pkcs11 engine explicitly.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Feb 2008 10:25:49 +0100

strongswan (4.1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    Closes: #455711: New upstream version 4.1.9
  * Updated Japanese debconf translation.
    Closes: #463321: strongswan: [INTL:ja] Update po-debconf template 
                     translation (ja.po)

strongswan (4.1.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force use of hardening-wrapper when building the package by setting
    a Build-Dep to it and setting export DEB_BUILD_HARDENING=1 in
    debian/rules.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Feb 2008 14:14:48 +0100

strongswan (4.1.8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ship our own init script, since upstream no longer does. This is still
    installed as /etc/init.d/ipsec (and not /etc/init.d/strongswan) to be 
    backwards compatible.
    Really closes: #442880: strongswan: postinst failure (missing 
                            /etc/init.d/ipsec)
  * Actually, need to be smarter with ipsec.conf and ipsec.secrets. Not
    marking them as conffiles isn't the right thing either. Instead, now
    use the includes feature to pull in config snippets that are
    modified by debconf. It's not perfect, though, as the IKEv1/IKEv2
    protocols can't be enabled/disabled with includes. Therefore don't
    support this option in debconf for the time being, but default to
    enabled for both IKE versions. The files edited with debconf are kept
    under /var/lib/strongswan.
  * Cleanup debian/rules: no longer need to remove leftover files from 
    patching, as currently there are no Debian-specific patches (fortunately).
  * More cleanup: drop debconf translations hack for woody compatibility,
    depend on build-stamp instead of build in the install-strongswan target,
    and remove the now unnecessary dh_clean -k call in install-strongswan so
    that configure shouldn't run twice during building the package.
  * Update French debconf translation.
    Closes: #448327: strongswan: [INTL:fr] French debconf templates 
                     translation update

strongswan (4.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The "I'm back from my long semi-vacation, and strongswan is now bug-free 
  again" release.
  * New upstream release.
    Closes: #442880: strongswan: postinst failure (missing /etc/init.d/ipsec)
    Closes: #431874: strongswan - FTBFS: cannot create regular file 
                     `/etc/ipsec.conf': Permission denied
  * Explicitly use debhalper compatbility version 5m now using debian/compat
    instead of DH_COMPAT.
  * Since there's no configurability in dh_installdeb's mania to flag 
    everything below /etc as a conffile, now hack DEBIAN/conffiles directly
    to remove ipsec.conf and ipsec.secrets.
    Closes: #442929: strongswan: Maintainer script modifies conffiles
  * Add/update debconf translations.
    Closes: #432189: strongswan: [INTL:de] updated German debconf translation

strongswan (4.1.1-1) unreleased; urgency=low

  Major new upstream release:
  * IKEv2 support with the new "charon" daemon in addition to the old "pluto"
    which is still used for IKEv1.
  * Switches to auto* tools build system.
  * The postinst script is still not quite as complete in updating the 2.8.x
    config automatically to a new 4.x config, but I don't want to wait any
    longer with the upload. It can be improved later on.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Apr 2007 21:33:56 +0100

strongswan (2.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release with fixes for the SHA-512-HMAC function and

    Closes: #396179: strongswan: [INTL:ja] Updated Japanese po-debconf
                     template translation (ja.po)
  * Fix broken reference to a now non-existing config file. no_oe.conf
    has been replaced by oe.conf, with the opposite meaning. Changed
    postinst to deal with it correctly now, and also try to convert
    older config file lines to newer (e.g. when updating from openswan
    to strongswan).

strongswan (2.7.3+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Another try on getting it into unstable.
    Closes: #372267: ITP: strongswan -- second fork of freeswan.
  * Call debian-updatepo in the clean target, in line with the openswan
    change for its version 2.4.6+dfsg-1.
  * Remove man2html, htmldoc, and lynx from the Build-Deps because we no
    longer rebuild the documentation tree.
  * Starting shipping a lintian overrides file to finally silence the 
    warnings about non-standard-(file|dir)-perms (they are intentional).
  * Clean up /usr/lib/ipsec somehow, again owing to lintian warnings.
  * Add po-debconf to build dependencies.
    
 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Aug 2006 21:23:36 +0100

strongswan (2.7.2+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload to the main Debian archive. This does no longer build
    the linux-patch-strongswan and strongswan-modules-source packages,
    as KLIPS will be removed from the strongswan upstream source anyway
    for the next major release. However, the openswan KLIPS could should
    be interoperable with strongswan user space.
    Closes: #372267: ITP: strongswan -- second fork of freeswan.
  * This upload removes the draft RFCs, as they are not considered free under
    the DFSG.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Jul 2006 12:40:34 +0100

strongswan (2.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This release fixes a potential DoS problem.

 -- Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 12:34:43 +0100
 
strongswan (2.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian packaging of strongswan. This is directly based on my
    Debian package of openswan 2.4.5-3.
  * Do not compile and ship fswcert right now, because it is not included
    in strongswan upstream. If it turns out to be necessary for supporting
    easy-to-use OE in the future (i.e. for generating the DNS format for the
    public keys from generated X.509 certificates), I will re-add it to the
    Debian package.
  * Also disabled my patches to use /etc/default instead of /etc/sysconfig for
    now. Something like that will be necessary in the future, but those parts
    of strongswan differ significanty from openswan.
